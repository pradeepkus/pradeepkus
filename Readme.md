This repository contains a k-means clustering code that classifies 600 hPa geopotential height fields into distinct clusters based on the similarity of spatial patterns. It also includes the procedure for determining the optimal number of clusters using the Silhouette Coefficient and the Elbow Method. The methodology is based on the paper “Classification of Mid-Tropospheric Cyclones over the Arabian Sea” and can be adapted for similar atmospheric classification studies.
